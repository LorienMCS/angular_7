####This was a project for the 17th week of the Full Stack Program at [Galvanize](http://www.galvanize.com/courses/full-stack/). The seed data photos are from actual Reddit posts, and the seed text is from [Veggie ipsum](http://veggieipsum.com/).

##Angular Reddit Clone

Requirements:

* Each post has a title, author, image, and description.
* Each post's date/time is displayed nicely: "Yesterday at 3:09pm", "Last Thursday at 4:42am", etc. You will need an external library. 
* A user can upvote/downvote posts.
* Posts dynamically reorder according to number of votes.
* A user can create new posts.
* A user cannot create a new post if any of the 4 inputs are blank.  Research angular validations.
* A user can click to view existing comments on a specific post.
* The number of comments is correctly pluralized.
* A user can add a new comment to a specific post.
* The new post form and comment forms can be toggled on and off.
* A user can search through posts.
* A user can sort posts by votes, date, and title.
* Animate posts as they are added and removed from the search results.  Research Angular animations.
* Style the app.
